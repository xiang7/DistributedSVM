DistributedSVM
==============

Towards a better attack resiliency


Current Task
============
Luojie:

find cluster code for c, and figure out the adaptive cluster implementation

Shunrang:

implement MPI SVM training (Approach 1 ensemble). 
write experiment of training on single/multiple machine, compare the time with different training set size



Done
============

Luojie:

training sets: Get at least two datasets, preprocess into libsvm input format
attack sets: implement the attacks, and apply them to the training set to get attack sets

Shunrang:

Setup libsvm library.

Implement paralleled SVM training.
